# Vanita

![Extension logo](/res/logo.png)

Save, and wear Roblox outfits with nice-to-have features like importing, exporting, and tagging.

## FAQ

### What are the main features?

- Save beyond the 50 outfit limit.
- Import, and export your outfits.
- Organize your outfits with tags.
- Search through your outfits either by name, or by the tags.
- Automatically and manually backup your outfits to the cloud via Google Drive.

### Why choose this over other Roblox extensions?

- Full access to the source code as this project is open source under the AGPL-3.0 license.
- Roblox stays vanilla, as the site isn't touched.
- No data collection, as your privacy is respected.
- Free of charge, but donations are appreciated.

### How to install the extension?

You can get the extension either directly from the latest [GitHub release](https://github.com/Daw588/vanita/releases/latest), or through the [Google Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/vanita/dcmbddbidlgkkaaiogiecbbjimjeicmo), though the Google Web Store is preferred option, if you are not familiar with installing unpacked extensions, or if you don't want to manually update the extension on each release. You can also build the extension yourself using the source code, if that is your cup of tea.

### How can I support the development?

You can donate to me, as by doing so you also support the project, because the more money I receive, the more time I will be able to allocate to work on this project, and with enough consistent donations I will be able to make this project my full time job. You can also share the extension with others, as by doing so, you bring more attention to the project, which will help me enable more people to access powerful features related to creation of outfits on Roblox.

### Why AGPL-3.0 over MIT license?

The MIT license doesn't prevent a company from just forking the project, and making proprietary version of it. If this were to happen, it would break my promise of free of charge, and open-source. With AGPL-3.0, even if I pass away one day, it will ensure that you get to keep using this extension free of charge with full access to the source code of a future fork.
