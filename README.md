## FAQ

### What are the main features?

### Why choose this over other Roblox extensions?

- Full access to the source code as this project is open source under the AGPL-3.0 license.
- Roblox stays vanilla, as the site isn't touched.
- No data collection, as your privacy is respected.
- Free of charge, but donations are appreciated.

### How to install the extension?

You can get the extension either directly from the latest [GitHub release](https://github.com/Daw588/vanita/releases/latest), or through the [Google Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/vanita/dcmbddbidlgkkaaiogiecbbjimjeicmo), though the Google Web Store is preferred option, if you are not familiar with installing unpacked extensions, or if you don't want to manually update the extension on each release. You can also build the extension yourself using the source code, if that is your cup of tea.

### How can I support the development?

You can subscribe to one of my monthly supporter tiers that can be found on my [Discord server](https://discord.gg/wR2wykwUeD). If you would like to do one-time donation or subscribe through a different service like Patreon, please let me know!

### Why AGPL-3.0 over MIT license?

The MIT license doesn't prevent a company from just forking the project, and making proprietary version of it. If this were to happen, it would break my promise of free of charge, and open-source. With AGPL-3.0, even if I pass away one day, it will ensure that you get to keep using this extension free of charge with full access to the source code of a future fork.
